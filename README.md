# NuMorph #

NuMoprh is a set of image analysis tools for quanityfing nuclei and classifying cell-types in tissue cleared whole brain images. We are working diligently to integrate all the pieces of NuMorph. A quick start guide is available in the Wiki page, along with some [test data]. A more detail manual will be made available by the end of October. 

In case the BRAIN-I image download service is down, [here is a link] to the annotation data using for training the 3D-Unet model in the paper.
